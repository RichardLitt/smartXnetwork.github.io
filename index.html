        <h4 style="font-size: 20px; color: #888888; text-align: center">How it works</h4>
        <h5 style="text-align: center"><i class="fa fa-id-card" style="color:orange; font-size:xx-large; width:100%; margin-top: 10px"></i> Set up your smartID</h5>
        <p style="text-align: center">Get your secure and simple smart identity with built in digital signatures based on PKI technology. Each individual is issued a unique public-private keypair that acts as
            their identifier and password for authentication. Each entry in the smartX database is signed by writing peer's corresponding keypair. Complete your profile including social handles to showcase your true self.</p>
        <h5 style="text-align: center"><i class="fa fa-money" style="color:orange; font-size:xx-large; width:100%; margin-top: 10px"></i> Get verified and claim your smartCash</h5>
        <p style="text-align: center">Once you've created your account you need to get verified from an existing verified
            peer to claim your smartCash and start participating in network activities. Monetary supply is fixed in smartX network but unlike other hard cryptocurrencies it's given directly to people and only minted at a transparent rate when a new verified peer joins the network. Early you join more you get.
        </p>
        <h5 style="text-align: center"><i class="fa fa-shopping-cart" style="color:orange; font-size:xx-large; width:100%; margin-top: 10px"></i> Start verifying others and participating in markets</h5>
        <p style="text-align: center">Now you can start verifying your friends and keep earning 2.5% per verification (verify only those you personally know else you risk losing all your wealth). Soon you'll be able to create, explore and trade tokens for any kind of digital good - from tweets to videos to memes - with built in incentive and compliance rules.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px; color: #888888;">FAQs</h4>
        <h5>Why smartX matters?</h5>
        <p>World economy is ruled by intermediaries - companies, governments, banks - with too much power and incentives in the hands of a few; making only rich, richer.

            Value creation opportunities have been limited for average joe and far too much value is lost due to inefficiency created by poor and complex socio-economic models such as inflationary monetary policies, unaccountable governance, bureaucratic red tapes, interface proliferation, data hoarding to name a few.

            "The last crisis did not hit us despite the presence of our monetary and
            financial authorities. It hit us because of them."
            <br><br>
            smartX wants to change this with “social capitalism” where everyone has an opportunity to be a solopreneur on top of a unified system.

            Mission is to build a smart, truly digital self-sovereign society that empowers everyone in the world to seamlessly manage any kind of socio-economic activities; unlocking more wealth and giving more freedom to the masses.
            <br><br>
            If internet and social media helped create value, smartX will help capture and exchange value.
        </p>

        <h5>Who can join smartX?</h5>
        <p>SmartX is like a global village where everyone is welcome - from an unbanked person in Kenya to a banker on Wall st anyone is free to join and participate. smartX bridges the gap among
            creators, curators, consumers
            and market makers through a smart open economy where value is captured from everything.
            <br><br>
            Anyone can become a collaborator, investor and winner in this new world through nothing but their skills.
            Imagine value unlocked by such digitization: original creators get royalty, curators, fans & market makers get to own &
            invest in future, consumers get better discovery and much more.
        </p>
        <h5>Why do I need to get verified?</h5>
        <p>smartX is a purely peer to peer system i.e. no central party like Government, Bank or Company controls it.
            So in order to protect everyone's wealth and make sure each individual receives smartCash only once. </p>
        <h5>What's the reward-risk with verification?</h5>
        <p>The system simply relies on incentive/mechanism design principles to function. If you behave as per
            rules you get rewarded (e.g. 2.5% of smartCash of each peer you verify comes back to you)
            but if you try to perform malice by verifying fake peers you not only lose all your wealth and
            reputation but also end up diluting the value of smartCash.</p>
        <h5>How is smartCash minted and issued?</h5>
        <p>smartCash is minted as per natural log based token minting function.

            Not only it makes experience
            frictionless & viral but also offers a fair way to distribute money. Anyone can tell right now how
            much a billionth member will get with certainty!
            With this model we're pretty much guaranteed to see supply proportional to network growth / utility.
        </p>
        <h5>Is my private data secure?</h5>
        <p>All your sensitive data e.g. private keys, ID proof etc. never leaves your machine and seen by anyone. However
            you must ensure safety of your machine and browser storage.</p>
        <h5>Who owns and runs smartX?</h5>
        <p>smartX is meant to be open source application/DAO built on a suite of simple protocols and features to build a smart, truly digital economy.
            Anyone who wants to give real wealth, freedom and power back to people is welcome to join and contribute to the endeavor.</p>
        <h5>How can I use smartCash?</h5>
        <p>As internet's socio-economic layer, smartX will help you invest in a tweet, trade memes on reddit, create contracts on house,
            request college degrees, buy a photo on insta, watch a premium video on youtube, pay to chat on messenger or simply tip on anyone's blog!</p>
        <h5>How to create smartItems / tokens?</h5>
        <p>Under the hood smartX uses generic curved bonding structure for pricing and minting tokens, and creating automated markets on
            IPFS based universal token & transfer protocol. Anyone can basically create tokens representing any underlying good (in the form of url), pricing mechanism, incentive structure and compliance rules.
            When someone buys that token not only they own that item but also automatically benefit from baked in incentives and follow associated regulatory mechanism.
